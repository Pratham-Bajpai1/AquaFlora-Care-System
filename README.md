## Project Overview üöÄ

### Soil Moisture Monitoring:
- The Arduino Uno collects and processes data from the soil moisture sensor to determine the current soil moisture level.

### Temperature and Humidity Monitoring:
- Simultaneously, the DHT11 sensor measures the ambient temperature and humidity in the plant's environment.

### Control of Water Pump:
- When the soil moisture level falls below a preset threshold, the Arduino activates the relay module, which then controls the water pump to irrigate the plant.

### Battery-Powered Operation:
- Two separate batteries are used: a 9-volt battery for the Arduino and sensors, and a 12-volt battery to power the water pump through the relay.

### Data Transmission:
- The Arduino communicates with a Bluetooth module (HC-05) to transmit both soil moisture and DHT11 sensor data to a laptop.

### Data Logging with Python:
- A Python script running on the laptop logs the received data into a CSV file, continuously collecting and logging soil moisture data.

### Power BI Data Visualization:
- The CSV file with combined data is imported into Power BI, transforming it into an interactive dashboard presenting real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.

### User Interaction:
- Users can access the Power BI dashboard to monitor plant conditions, customize soil moisture thresholds, and make informed decisions about watering and plant care based on environmental factors.

## How It Works üîÑ

1. **Data Collection:** The Arduino collects soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data.
2. **Threshold Check:** If soil moisture falls below a preset threshold, the water pump is activated.
3. **Data Transmission:** Data is transmitted to a laptop via Bluetooth.
4. **Data Logging:** Python script logs data into a CSV file.
5. **Data Visualization:** Power BI creates an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring.
6. **User Interaction:** Users access the dashboard to customize settings and monitor plant conditions.
